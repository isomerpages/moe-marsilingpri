<p>Warmest greetings and a Happy 2024!</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well and filled with anticipation for the
upcoming school year. The start of a new school year is always a time of
renewed energy and fresh possibilities. It is a time to embrace new challenges,
forge new friendships, and pursue holistic learning experiences.</p>
<p>This year, we will continue to build on the foundation of culture of care
and excellence that defines Marsiling Primary School. Our dedicated staff
are committed to providing a nurturing and engaging learning environment
where students can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>School Vision, Mission and Values</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At MPS, our vision is centered on cultivating <strong>Learners and Leaders of Tomorrow</strong>.
We envision a dynamic educational environment that not only imparts knowledge
but also fosters the development of critical skills and qualities essential
for the future. We aspire to empower our students to become lifelong learners,
equipped with the adaptability and resilience to thrive in an ever-changing
world. As we nurture positive learning dispositions, we concurrently instill
leadership qualities, encouraging our students to think innovatively, collaborate
effectively, and contribute meaningfully to their communities. Leaders
of tomorrow are leaders who are forward looking, confident, values-driven
and they are able to lead self and others. Our commitment lies in shaping
well-rounded individuals who, armed with knowledge, empathy, and a sense
of social responsibility, are poised to become the trailblazers and change-makers
of the future.</p>
<p>As for school mission, we are dedicated in <strong>Nurturing Resilient Learners who are Future Ready</strong> and
also committed in <strong>Growing</strong>  <strong>Confident Leaders who are Values Driven</strong>.
Our mission is to nurture learners who will pursue their aspirations with
tenacity and have the G<em>rowth Mindset</em> to embrace change and overcome
challenges to adapt to an ever-evolving world. We are also equipping our
Marsilians with the knowledge and enhanced 21CC skills such as critical
thinking and effective communication skills. Simultaneously, we strive
to instill leadership qualities grounded in values. Confident leaders mean
being able to lead self &amp; others; and being leaders who are driven
by values. We would like our Marsilians to be confident of themselves,
confident in articulating their views, confident to act with moral courage
and help others. Our commitment is to provide an education that not only
imparts knowledge but also shapes character, empowering students to be
future-ready, adaptable, and confident leaders.</p>
<p>Embedded in our daily practices are the school values that define who
we are as a school community. Our school values of <strong>R3.I.C.E (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence) </strong>serve
as the pillars of our educational philosophy as they guide our interactions,
decision-making processes, and the overall ethos of MPS. Character and
values education has always been an integral part of our students’ learning
in MPS.</p>
<p>To complement our school’s vision, mission and values, I introduced the
Marsilian ‘ABCs’ to our students since 2022 with the aim to encourage them
to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A</strong>spire &amp;
aim high</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>B</strong>elieve in
themselves</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>ourage to
give their best each time</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>ALP &amp; LLP @ MPS</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Through our school programmes and activities, we will continue to provide
our students with meaningful experiences, a positive learning environment
to learn, grow and thrive; and opportunities to explore their interests
and pursue their talents. We do this through our curriculum across all
subjects, a spectrum of learning experiences and school-based programmes.
In addition, our <strong><em>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – SPARKS@MPS [Spark Ideas, Spark Interest, Spark Action: Igniting A Passion for Purposeful Storytelling]</em></strong> aims
to nurture critical thinkers and confident communicators who listen actively
and demonstrate the ability to articulate their ideas. SPARKS@MPS also
aims to develop active contributors who rally others to action through
the use of engaging narratives. Our <strong><em>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – ‘LEAD&nbsp; (Learn, Engage, Absorb, Demonstrate) to Serve @ MPS’</em></strong> focuses
on leading self and others, as well as service leadership. The aim is to
provide leadership opportunities for all students to ‘Learn, Lead and Serve’
using a 3-tiered approach to LEAD to Serve @MPS, bringing together student
leadership development and leveraging the VIA platforms within the Green
Citizenship (GC)@MPS curriculum. Through these platforms, we aim to instill
in every Marsilian our school values and nurture responsible active citizenship
through service leadership.</p>
<p>As we navigate the school year ahead, communication will be key. Please
stay connected with our school community through our website, official
Facebook and Instagram page, newsletters, and other communication channels.
We encourage you to actively participate in school events, parent-teacher
conferences, and other opportunities to engage with the learning process.</p>
<p>I am excited about the possibilities that the 2024 school year holds,
and I look forward to witnessing the growth and achievements of each and
every student. Let us work together to make this a memorable and successful
school year.</p>
<p>Wishing all of you a fantastic start to the 2024 school year!</p>
<p></p>
