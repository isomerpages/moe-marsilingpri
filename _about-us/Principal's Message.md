<p>Warmest greetings and a Happy 2024!</p><p>I hope this message finds you well and filled with anticipation for the upcoming school year. The start of a new school year is always a time of renewed energy and fresh possibilities. It is a time to embrace new challenges, forge new friendships, and pursue holistic learning experiences.</p><p>This year, we will continue to build on the foundation of culture of care and excellence that defines Marsiling Primary School. Our dedicated staff are committed to providing a nurturing and engaging learning environment where students can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>School Vision, Mission and Values</em></strong></p><p>At MPS, our vision is centered on cultivating <strong>Learners and Leaders of Tomorrow</strong>. We envision a dynamic educational environment that not only imparts knowledge but also fosters the development of critical skills and qualities essential for the future. We aspire to empower our students to become lifelong learners, equipped with the adaptability and resilience to thrive in an ever-changing world. As we nurture positive learning dispositions, we concurrently instill leadership qualities, encouraging our students to think innovatively, collaborate effectively, and contribute meaningfully to their communities. Leaders of tomorrow are leaders who are forward looking, confident, values-driven and they are able to lead self and others. Our commitment lies in shaping well-rounded individuals who, armed with knowledge, empathy, and a sense of social responsibility, are poised to become the trailblazers and change-makers of the future.</p><p>As for school mission, we are dedicated in <strong>Nurturing Resilient Learners who are Future Ready</strong> and also committed in <strong>Growing</strong> <strong>Confident Leaders who are Values Driven</strong>. Our mission is to nurture learners who will pursue their aspirations with tenacity and have the G<em>rowth Mindset</em> to embrace change and overcome challenges to adapt to an ever-evolving world. We are also equipping our Marsilians with the knowledge and enhanced 21CC skills such as critical thinking and effective communication skills. Simultaneously, we strive to instill leadership qualities grounded in values. Confident leaders mean being able to lead self &amp; others; and being leaders who are driven by values. We would like our Marsilians to be confident of themselves, confident in articulating their views, confident to act with moral courage and help others. Our commitment is to provide an education that not only imparts knowledge but also shapes character, empowering students to be future-ready, adaptable, and confident leaders.</p><p>Embedded in our daily practices are the school values that define who we are as a school community. Our school values of <strong>R3.I.C.E (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence) </strong>serve as the pillars of our educational philosophy as they guide our interactions, decision-making processes, and the overall ethos of MPS. Character and values education has always been an integral part of our students’ learning in MPS.</p><p>To complement our school’s vision, mission and values, I introduced the Marsilian ‘ABCs’ to our students since 2022 with the aim to encourage them to:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A</strong>spire &amp; aim high</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>B</strong>elieve in themselves</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C</strong>ourage to give their best each time</p><p></p><p><strong><em>ALP &amp; LLP @ MPS</em></strong></p><p>Through our school programmes and activities, we will continue to provide our students with meaningful experiences, a positive learning environment to learn, grow and thrive; and opportunities to explore their interests and pursue their talents. We do this through our curriculum across all subjects, a spectrum of learning experiences and school-based programmes. In addition, our <strong><em>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – SPARKS@MPS [Spark Ideas, Spark Interest, Spark Action: Igniting A Passion for Purposeful Storytelling]</em></strong> aims to nurture critical thinkers and confident communicators who listen actively and demonstrate the ability to articulate their ideas. SPARKS@MPS also aims to develop active contributors who rally others to action through the use of engaging narratives. Our <strong><em>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – ‘LEAD&nbsp; (Learn, Engage, Absorb, Demonstrate) to Serve @ MPS’</em></strong> focuses on leading self and others, as well as service leadership. The aim is to provide leadership opportunities for all students to ‘Learn, Lead and Serve’ using a 3-tiered approach to LEAD to Serve @MPS, bringing together student leadership development and leveraging the VIA platforms within the Green Citizenship (GC)@MPS curriculum. Through these platforms, we aim to instill in every Marsilian our school values and nurture responsible active citizenship through service leadership.</p><p>As we navigate the school year ahead, communication will be key. Please stay connected with our school community through our website, official Facebook and Instagram page, newsletters, and other communication channels. We encourage you to actively participate in school events, parent-teacher conferences, and other opportunities to engage with the learning process.</p><p>I am excited about the possibilities that the 2024 school year holds, and I look forward to witnessing the growth and achievements of each and every student. Let us work together to make this a memorable and successful school year.</p><p>Wishing all of you a fantastic start to the 2024 school year!</p><p></p><p>Warmest regards,</p><p>Mrs Heather Thio</p><p>Principal</p><p></p>
