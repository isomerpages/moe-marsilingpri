Warmest greetings and a happy 2022 to all!

I am honoured to be part of Marsiling Primary School (MPS) which had over 60 years of history and given the opportunity to be the 11th Principal of the school. I am also thankful for the effort of all my predecessors and staff throughout the years which helped shaped the journey and successes of MPS to what it is today.

2021 has been another year where our students, staff and parents banded together to overcome the challenges of Covid-19. I am proud of our Marsilians who have stayed resilient in their learning, agile in adapting to changes, continually showed care to their peers and adhered to the safe management measures in school. This could not be possible without the hard work and caring hearts of our dedicated staff. I would also like to thank all parents for your support and understanding during this period. I am optimistic that as a school and as a community, we will all come out of Covid-19 stronger and more united.

Through our school programmes and activities, we will continue to provide our students with meaningful experiences, a positive learning environment to learn, grow and thrive; and  opportunities to explore their interests and pursue their talents.

In MPS, every child matters as we believe that **Every Marsilian Can Learn, Lead and Serve**. Our school is committed in **Nurturing Responsible Learners and Compassionate Leaders** and to develop their learning dispositions and attitudes to Learn for Life. We do this through our curriculum across all subjects, learning experiences and school-based programmes. In addition, our **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)** – **SPARKS@MPS** \[Spark Ideas, Spark Interest, Spark Action: Igniting A Passion for Purposeful Storytelling\] aims to nurture confident communicators who listen actively and demonstrate the ability to articulate their ideas and interests, and active contributors who rally others to action through the use of engaging narratives. Our **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)** – **Every Marsilian a Service Leader and Green Citizen** aims to nurture responsible active citizenship through service leadership using a 3-tiered approach in student leadership development.

We also place high emphasis in building student’s foundation in values, character and social-emotional competencies. The school values of **R3.I.C.E (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence)** coupled with our strengthened efforts to promote a **Growth Mindset** in our students, will guide and nurture our students to have a sound moral compass, better equipped to make good decisions and actions, to believe in themselves, to be resilient, to care for others and to give their best in all that they do.

It takes the whole community to raise our Marsilians. We value the partnership with our parents, PSG, SAC and community partners. We look forward to greater parental engagement and we encourage all parents and partners to journey with my team of dedicated and caring staff as we give our students an enriching learning experience. In our MPS experience, we would like our Marsilians to:

·       **A**spire & dare to dream

·       **B**elieve in themselves

·       **C**ourage to give their best every time

 To all our students and parents, I wish you a most fulfilling year ahead!
