<p>In 2017, as part of our school envisioning, we realised that we needed
to strengthen our students’ resilience in their perceptions of themselves
and their own abilities. We curated the 6 Growth Mindset (GM) messages
and created our GM Mascots, Sparkle and Ray. It was a school wide attempt
to shift our teachers’ and students’ mindsets about themselves and how
they respond to challenges. We designed our own staff PD package which
was implemented since 2017 and still running strong in 2024. We have successfully
brought our staff through 3 phases within the PD package. The latest being
phase 3.0 was drawn up in a 3-year plan that moved the school to the next
level of learning to enculturate and deepen the GM in our staff and students,
through our exploration of the Agile Learner Framework.</p>
<p>To promote a GM culture &amp; set a common GM language in our school,
we ensured that GM is pervasive across all depts and subjects, where the
GM messages and mascots are used to support the learning materials, e.g.
to constantly remind students to embrace new challenges in their learning.
GM is made visible around the school through classroom charts, school banners
&amp; posters, standees, student handbook and WBS gifts.</p>
<p>Our school was conferred the Innergy Award – Silver in 2020. This affirmed
the work that we do in our capacities as educators in nurturing and moulding
the future generation. We have seen positive changes in our students and
will continue to grow their GM and strengthen their self-efficacy.</p>
