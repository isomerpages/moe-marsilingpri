<p>In 2017, as part of our school envisioning, we realised that we needed
to strengthen our students’ resilience in their perceptions of themselves
and their own abilities. We curated the 6 Growth Mindset (GM) messages
and created our GM Mascots, Sparkle and Ray. It was a school wide attempt
to shift our teachers’ and students’ mindsets about themselves and how
they respond to challenges. We designed our own staff PD package which
was implemented since 2017 and still running strong in 2024. We have successfully
brought our staff through 3 phases within the PD package. The latest being
phase 3.0 was drawn up in a 3-year plan that moved the school to the next
level of learning to enculturate and deepen the GM in our staff and students,
through our exploration of the Agile Learner Framework.</p>
<p>To promote a GM culture &amp; set a common GM language in our school,
we ensured that GM is pervasive across all depts and subjects, where the
GM messages and mascots are used to support the learning materials, e.g.
to constantly remind students to embrace new challenges in their learning.
GM is made visible around the school through classroom charts, school banners
&amp; posters, standees, student handbook and WBS gifts.</p>
<p>Our school was conferred the Innergy Award – Silver in 2020. This affirmed
the work that we do in our capacities as educators in nurturing and moulding
the future generation. We have seen positive changes in our students and
will continue to grow their GM and strengthen their self-efficacy.</p>

<p>“To Write. To Inspire.” is a milestone joint project of our English Department
(ELD) and the Mother Tongue Languages Department (MTLD). It seeks to address
student learning gaps in writing skills and to level up staff capacity
in teaching writing. The ELD and MTLD leveraged strengths in curriculum
design to re-design the writing curriculum and process for both students
and staff. The departments’ curriculum re-design journey also culminated
in a professional collaboration where both departments collaborated to
print the literary works of our students and developed a portal to showcase
the work of our bilingual talents.</p>
<h4>ELD: Joy of Writing (JoW)</h4>
<p>Our team of teachers conceptualised the structure of the writing curriculum
by aligning the curriculum and content to the English Language syllabus
and took into consideration the Attitude, Skills and Knowledge (ASK) required
of writers. With the learners at heart, we identified issues that students
faced such as writers’ block, fear of writing and lack of prior knowledge
when given a theme. As learners were generally unmotivated when it came
to writing, we introduced strategies such as Quickwrites and Visible Thinking
Routines as key tools in a writing classroom. With the writing process
cycle and 6 traits of writing in mind, we created writing packages targeted
at improving the level’s writing. Each writing package consisted of interesting,
age-appropriate mini writing lessons and resources, which leveraged ICT
tools such as instructional videos, SLS interactive thinking tools and
Google Docs.</p>
<h4>MTLD: Making Writing Visible (MWV)</h4>
<p>Our team of teachers developed a structure to support the teaching of
writing skills, building MTV thinking routines into the Writing Curriculum.
The MTL created a refreshed Writing Curriculum and packages to support
the consistent teaching of writing. We developed structures and processes
(i.e.&nbsp; Visible Thinking routines such as “FEAST” and “Burger”) to
teach thinking, to scaffold thinking and to build content, into the Writing
Curriculum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school was conferred the Innergy Award – Silver in 2022. This affirmed
the work that we do in our capacities as educators in nurturing a love
for the languages and a love for writing. We have seen improvements in
our students’ ability to write and we are proud to see their literary works
featured in our school publication, “To Write. To Inspire.”</p>
