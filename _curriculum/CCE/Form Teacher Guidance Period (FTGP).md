Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) is an integral part of CCE that helps students to develop their Social and Emotional Competencies â€“ namely Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision Making. Lessons on Cyber Wellness (CW), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and Protection from Abuse (PFA) are also delivered through the FTGP curriculum.

FTGP provides time within curriculum for form teachers to engage in purposeful teacher-student interactions and class bonding through interaction activities within the period. The school has adopted Circle Time to build stronger teacher-student relationships.
