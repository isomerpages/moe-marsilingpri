**MPS Discipline Approach and Philosophy**

The school’s blended approach to discipline ensures that when students make mistakes, they have the opportunity, support and guidance from the school to change, while learning to take responsibility and be accountable for their actions.

The school uses a blend of behavourial change approaches and restorative practice to address mistake making by students. The ultimate aim to help the students develop self-discipline. The school wants to help students who make mistakes reflect upon their actions so that they will achieve lasting positive behaviour change, restore damaged relations and use the offending episode as a learning experience to ensure that responsible decision-making is developed and the offending behaviour is eventually extinguished.

The school aims to help students realise that it is important to live up to the school values. The school also works actively with parents and external agencies as partners to address students’ behaviour that requires improvement.

**Offences and Interventions**

While the school uses restorative practice to change student thinking through cognitive processing, the action-consequence nexus exists to complement this and provides balance in our applied character education and discipline efforts.
