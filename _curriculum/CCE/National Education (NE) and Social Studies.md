<h4>#1958 Heritage Gallery &amp; Marsiling Heritage Trail</h4>
<p>The #1958 Heritage Gallery and The Marsiling Heritage Trail were launched
on 16 November 2018 by then Second Minister for Education Ms Indranee Rajah.
In collaboration with the National Heritage Board, some P4 student leaders
conceptualised and developed the Marsiling Heritage Trail. Marsilians will
have a chance to go on, to familiarise themselves with the landmarks in
this neighbourhood and to have a deeper appreciation for the heritage of
the community in which our school is located.</p>

<h4>CCE &amp; Social Studies (SS) Cohort Learning Journeys</h4>
<p>To deepen their understanding and application of their learning in CCE
and Social Studies, all students are given the opportunity to go on experiential
learning journeys to places such as #1958 Heritage Gallery, Botanical Gardens,
River Safari, Geylang Seria Heritage Gallery, Indian Heritage Centre and
Asian Civilisations Museum. These platforms also create many opportunities
for students to learn to work in teams and practice school values as they
support each other in achieving shared goals in the activities designed
for their cognitive and social emotional development.</p>

<h4>Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW)</h4>
<p>To promote the development of 21st century skills and build the culture
of COL (collaborative learning) and SDL (self-directed learning), the school
creates opportunities for all students to be involved in interdisciplinary
Project Work where they work in teams to do research and presentation skills.
We encourage every students to develop a growth mindset in believing in
themselves as they persevere in their continuous journey to be effective
leaders who are confident in communicating their ideas, self-directed in
their learning and committed to build positive peer relationships through
respectful conversations.</p>
