#### GeM@MPS

Growth Mindset @ MPS or GeM@MPS is a whole-school approach adopted since 2017 to raise our students’ attainment and motivation. It aims to foster a culture of care and excellence in the school and nurture students’ inner drive to succeed, through deliberate efforts to build a growth mindset (GM), an affirmative teacher-student relationships (TSR) and peer support and relationships (PSR).

#### What is Growth Mindset?

World-renowned Stanford University psychologist and one of the world’s leading researchers in the field of psychology and motivation, Carol Dweck, has discovered the power of our mindset. She believes that having the right mindset is key to helping students attain success and motivation. In her research, she discussed about 2 types of mindsets – the growth mindset and fixed mindset. She learned that people with a fixed mindset avoid challenges, give up easily, see effort as fruitless, ignore useful negative feedback and feel threatened by the success of others. Whereas, those with a growth mindset tend to have the ability to embrace challenges, persists in the face of setbacks, see effort as a path to mastery, learn from criticism and are inspired by the successes of others.

Her work on mindsets has inspired us to embark on a journey to learn more about growth mindset. Her self-theories or incremental theory has shown us that the brain is far more malleable than we ever knew.

#### GM Mascots and Messages

GeM@MPS aims to develop our Marsilians into confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens in line with our school’s mission where we hope to nurture our Marsilians into **_Resilient Learners and Confident Leaders_** of tomorrow.

To help us increase the awareness on growth mindset, we conceptualized the 3 GM mascots and 6 GM messages in 2018. It was a collaborative effort from our students and teachers in coming up with the names for our 3 mascots. The whole school went through a voting process to help us select the names for our GM mascots. So, who are they?

Meet our GM Mascots – **_Sparkle, Ray and Dr FeMesis…_**
