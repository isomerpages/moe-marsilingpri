#### Creating a Caring and Enabling School Environment

We saw the potential of using GM as a key enabler to uplift our students and help every child believe that he can achieve his fullest potential. Our belief was simple yet powerful â€“ the explicit teaching of GM and building of affirmative relationships would impact student motivation and achievement. GeM@MPS promotes a common language and visible GM culture that focuses on building resilience and encourages positive interactions between students-teachers, students-students and students-parents. When all members of the school community articulate the same belief that every student can succeed, we make GM visible and provide a healthy ecosystem that allows the student to thrive and succeed.

We made our mascots into standees and banners and display them around the school to make the GM mascots and messages visible to all our students. This has helped in promoting consistent messaging and a common GM language amongst teachers and students. The GM messages and mascots are pervasively infused into teaching and learning, to constantly remind students to apply GM in whatever they do. The mascots unite the students, make everyone feel included, and connect students to one another and to the school.
