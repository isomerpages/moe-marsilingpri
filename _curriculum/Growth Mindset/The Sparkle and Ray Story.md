Back in 2017, Sparkle and Ray joined Marsiling Primary School, as our Growth Mindset mascots. Sparkle is one who always have bright sparks in her eyes, especially when she feels joyful in learning new things. Sparkle is always curious and often reads more to gain more knowledge about the things she learns in school.

She has resilience and grit. She believes that her intelligence can be developed by learning a new skill. She realizes that, when learning something new, it may seem difficult at first but she never gives up. She believes that effort is important and she will keep practising the new skill until she becomes good at it.

Ray is like the sunlight that brightens up other people’s day. When he is down, or feeling disappointed, he will look at the bright side of things and think of helpful ways to overcome the challenges he faced. Like Sparkle, he also has resilience and grit. He will learn from his mistakes and keep an open mind to new ideas and possibilities.

He has the courage to seek help whenever he is struggling in his work. He is a good peer supporter and a positive influence to his peers.

Both sparkle and Ray are our role models. They aspire to achieve their goals, believe that they can strive and achieve and have great courage in learning new skills and embracing challenges that come their way. Let’s all be like Sparkle and Ray and be Resilient Learners and Confident Leaders, just like them!
