| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Marsiling Art Xperience (MAX)    |     | In Marsiling Primary School, all students are exposed to 4 different Art forms throughout the 6 years â€“ drawing, painting, printmaking and sculpting. Through the exploration of different media and forms, students learn and apply the Elements of Art and Principles of Design. Every art project involves a discussion of an artwork by a selected artist, followed by the art-making process and finally closing with a gallery walk and peer critique.     |
| Art MasterClasses    |     | Middle Primary students who show the right aptitude in drawing and painting will be invited to join the Drawing and Painting MasterClasses to further develop their potential in the respective Art forms. These enrichment classes are held outside curriculum hours.     |
| Museum-Based Education   |     | P4 students are involved in this programme. They would learn how to respond to an artwork using the See-Think-Wonder approach. The programme includes a trip to the National Gallery of Singapore where they would be looking at artworks done by pioneer local artists such as Georgette Chen. This will be followed up by a watercolour painting project, drawing inspiration from what they have seen at the gallery.     |
