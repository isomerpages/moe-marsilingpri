#### **Joy of Reading**

To instill a love of reading and develop avid readers, we have organised a series of programmes to engage our pupils in reading. Besides Our Reading Wonderland (school library) which is an interactive hub promoting reading through thematic book displays, book sharings and literature quizzes, there are also weekly reading periods promoting different book genres and an uninterrupted reading time. We also provide a wide variety of reading resources such e-books on an online reading platform, P1 graded readers series and news articles on Little Red Dot. Students will complete reading interest profile survey at the beginning of year and select books of their interest. They will reflect on the books that they have read through book reviews and reading extension activities.

#### **EL Fiesta**  

EL Fiesta is a celebration of English Language Learning. Students will learn about the various genres through various fun activities such as role-playing, word games, recreating characters and writing stories based on the genre. Teachers join in the fun as characters from story books and bring students into the world of books. At the same time, students at the various levels will have the opportunity to showcase their talent through Choral Reading, Readers’ Theatre and Speech and Drama.
