<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>Joy of Reading</h4>
<p>To instill a love of reading and develop avid readers, we have organised
a series of programmes to engage our students in reading. Besides Our Reading
Wonderland (school library) which is an interactive hub promoting reading
through thematic book displays, book sharings and literature quizzes, there
are also weekly reading periods, promoting different book genres and an
uninterrupted reading time. We also provide a wide variety of reading resources
such e-books on an online reading platform, P1 and P2 graded readers series
as well as P3 to P6 Extensive Starter Kits in the class library. To expose
them to non-fiction texts and the world around them, the P3 to P6 students
also read news articles on Little Red Dot. All students will reflect on
the books that they have read through book reviews and reading extension
activities as they complete the Reading Ranger Booklets (P1 and P2) and
Reading Leader Booklets (P3 to P6) to earn a reading token.</p>

<h4>EL Fiesta</h4>
<p>EL Fiesta is a celebration of English Language Learning. Students will
learn about the various genres through various fun activities such as role-playing,
word games, recreating characters and writing parts of stories based on
the genre. Teachers join in the fun as characters from story books and
bring students into the world of books. It is a day of fun and games as
the students explore the use of the language and learn more about the genre
through a carnival.</p>

<h4>MTV Joy of Learning</h4>
<p>To help students enjoy learning English in a fun and interactive way,
we have planned a series of activities during recess. These activities
include storytelling by teachers and games such as Crack the Code, Boggle
and animal riddles. Incorporating games into English language learning
helps enhance the overall language experience as games promote active participation
and foster a positive learning environment. By making learning enjoyable
and motivating, students can gain more confidence in using the English
language.</p>

<h4>Joy of Writing</h4>
<p>Joy of Writing is designed to ignite a love for writing in the students.
The lessons are crafted to help them pick up writer’s crafts and foster
their imagination. Through the use of writing process cycles and various
mini lessons, the students discover the joy and power of penning down their
thoughts using words. Writing is not only a skill but also a delightful
adventure of creativity.</p>
