**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 pupils. It offers learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful.

**Objectives of PAL**  
PAL contributes to the **development of soft skills** in Marsilians such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others which are important Social and Emotional (SE) competencies. There are platforms for experiential learning – experimentation, exploration and achieving success. Opportunities are also provided for Marsilians to go through learning experiences to acquire a range of skills as well as interaction with friends and thereby developing confidence.

As a Marsilian, you will receive broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in two broad areas: (a) Sports & Games and Outdoor Education and (b) Performing Arts (Music and Dance) and Visual Arts. The modules facilitate holistic development of pupils in the five domains, that is, moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics. It also provides varied avenues for Marsilians to develop social and emotional competencies.
