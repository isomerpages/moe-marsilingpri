<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STEAM@MPS</h4>
<p>STEAM@MPS aims to provide students with the opportunity to learn through
exploration, sparking invention, innovation and joy of learning and to
enthuse students to explore the areas of STEAM. STEAM@MPS nurtures the
hard scientific skills of STEAM and the soft skills of collaboration, creativity
and problem solving. Based on the engineering design process, lesson packages
were designed for learning, via experimentation and problem solving with
a focus on nurturing different components of 21CC. In addition, students
look forward to the many recess activities and assembly programs planned
during STEAM@MPS week. Students are also engaged through the various STEM
Playground Challenges hosted by Singapore Science Centre and James Dyson
Foundation.</p>

<h4>The Science SPARKLE</h4>
<p>The Science SPARKLE lessons facilitate the learning of science for our
lower block students. Developed with the aim of making science accessible
and exciting, these lessons include a variety of experiments and activities
that cover a wide range of scientific concepts in the revised primary science
syllabus.</p>
<p>Students are engaged in rich discussions in class enabling them to retain
learning in a fun way. The Science SPARKLE lessons are more than just experiments;
They are catalysts for a lifelong love of science. It empowers students
to explore, question, and discover.</p>
