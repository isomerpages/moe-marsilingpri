<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>INquiring and INspired Marsilians; INnovators of Tomorrow&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Build on students’ interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves
and their environment. (Joy of Learning)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand themselves and
the world around them. (Understanding Nature of Scientific Knowledge)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop skills, dispositions, and attitudes for scientific inquiry and
apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions. (Demonstrating
Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate how Science influences people and the environment. (Relating
Science-Technology-Society-Environment)</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STEAM@MPS</h4>
<h4>Programme Description</h4>
<p>STEAM is an interdisciplinary approach to learning that combines Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. A collaborative effort between
the Science and Mathematics department, STEAM@MPS aims to provide students
with the opportunity to learn through exploration, sparking invention,
innovation and joy of learning and to enthuse students to explore the areas
of STEAM. STEAM@MPS nurtures the hard scientific skills of STEAM and the
soft skills of collaboration, creativity and problem solving. Based on
the engineering design process, lesson packages were designed for learning,
via experimentation and problem solving with a focus on nurturing different
components of 21CC, such as adaptive and inventive thinking and communication.
In addition, students look forward to the many recess activities and assembly
programs planned during STEAM@MPS week. Students are also engaged through
the various STEM Playground Challenges hosted by Singapore Science Centre
and James Dyson Foundation.</p>

<h4>The Science SPARKLE</h4>
<p>The Science SPARKLE lessons facilitate the learning of science for our
lower block students. Developed with the aim of making science accessible
and exciting, these lessons include a variety of experiments and activities
that cover a wide range of scientific concepts in the revised primary science
syllabus.</p>
<p>Students are engaged in rich discussions in class enabling them to retain
learning in a fun way. The Science SPARKLE lessons are more than just experiments;
They are catalysts for a lifelong love of science. It empowers students
to explore, question, and discover with mental attitudes such as curiosity,
creativity, integrity, objectivity, open-mindedness and resilience.</p>
<p>“I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” – Thomas
A. Edison</p>
<p>Just like Sir Thomas Edison, the Science SPARKLE lessons encourage our
students to not give up on the pursuit for solutions and be willing to
take risks and embrace failure as part of the process.</p>

<h4>Science@FaSCInation</h4>
<p>Science@FaSCInation, a Science MTV (Making Things Visible) learning space,
comes alive during recess. Students explore forensic science through investigations.
The space allows them to see the applications of Science beyond the syllabus
and use the process skills acquired in class to solve the crime. Students
get the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities that ignite their
curiosity and passion for Science as they play the role of a forensic scientist.
Beyond forensic science, students can also engage in experiments that deepens
their understanding and allows them to demonstrate ways and thinking of
doing Science.</p>
