<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STEAM@MPS</h4>
<h4>Programme Description</h4>
<p>STEAM is an interdisciplinary approach to learning that combines Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. A collaborative effort between
the Science and Mathematics department, STEAM@MPS aims to provide students
with the opportunity to learn through exploration, sparking invention,
innovation and joy of learning and to enthuse students to explore the areas
of STEAM. STEAM@MPS nurtures the hard scientific skills of STEAM and the
soft skills of collaboration, creativity and problem solving. Based on
the engineering design process, lesson packages were designed for learning,
via experimentation and problem solving with a focus on nurturing different
components of 21CC, such as adaptive and inventive thinking and communication.
In addition, students look forward to the many recess activities and assembly
programs planned during STEAM@MPS week. Students are also engaged through
the various STEM Playground Challenges hosted by Singapore Science Centre
and James Dyson Foundation.</p>
