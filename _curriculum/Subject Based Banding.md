Subject-based Banding (SBB) provides greater flexibility for your child by offering him/her the option of a combination of standard and foundation subjects, depending on his/her strengths. This will allow your child to focus on and stretch his/her potential in the subjects that he/she is strong in while building up the fundamentals in the subjects that he/she needs more support in.
