<h4>Lower Primary Games (LPG)</h4>
<p>Lower Primary students are taught a variety of fundamental movements (locomotor
and non-locomotor skills) and manipulative skills during PE lessons.</p>
<p>The Lower Primary Games is an annual sports event for Primary 1 and 2
students to showcase their PE skills by taking part in exciting games.
They will perform and demonstrate what they have learned in PE in front
of their parents, who are specially invited to the event.</p>
<p>Parents get to participate in the parent-child game during the event.
This parent-child game not only helps to build and strengthen their relationship,
but it also allows parents to understand what their child is learning during
PE lessons and its importance in the holistic development of the child.</p>

activities such as Captain's Ball, Floorball, modified Volleyball, and
