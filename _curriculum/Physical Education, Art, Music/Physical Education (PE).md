<h4>Sports Education Programme: Trampoline</h4>
<p>Rebounding is introduced to Primary 1 and 2 students as part of the Sports
Education Programme to encourage sports participation in schools and increase
sporting opportunities for the young.</p>
<p>Rebounding is a type of aerobic exercise performed while jumping on a
mini trampoline. It is key to developing the ABCs (agility, balance, coordination)
skills necessary for children to enjoy a variety of other sports and games.
Students will get to experience rebounding to the tempo of music during
the programme.</p>
