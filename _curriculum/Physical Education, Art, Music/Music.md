<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>Engaging With Songs, Our World Through Songs</h4>
<p>Primary 1 to Primary 4 students embark on a global musical journey in
this programme. They delve into a vibrant array of melodies and songs hailing
from diverse corners of the world. Beyond simply experiencing the tunes,
they immerse themselves in understanding, grasping, and mastering the musical
elements.</p>
<p>But there's more to it than just beats and rhythms! Our students are whisked
away into the rich tapestry of socio-historical narratives and cultural
landscapes associated with each song's country of origin. It's not just
about the music; it's a voyage through history and culture, all wrapped
up in the universal language of melody.</p>
