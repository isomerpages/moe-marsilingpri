**Values In Action**

At Marsiling Primary School, we believe in providing our pupils with a holistic education. We hope that by getting  
our pupils involved in the community and providing rich experiences, Marsilians can develop as socially responsible  
citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. Through the learning and application of values, knowledge and  
skills, we hope that our pupils will have greater social awareness and become compassionate leaders.

As a Marsilian, you will have the opportunity to learn and contribute to the community via programmes shown in the table  
featured below. We hope that  you will always bear in mind our school values, **R**espect,  
**I**ntegrity, **C**ommitment & **E**sprit de Corp (RICE) and practise these values  
in all the activities that you participate.
