**Key Programmes:**

**Project Coffee Compost:**  
Primary 4 students are engaged to collect and recycle coffee grounds from cafes and turn the coffee grounds into fertiliser. The fertiliser is used in the school’s gardens and also distributed back to the community as a way of “giving back”. To increase greater ownership and nurture greater sense of responsibility in our students, in 2015, the project extends with our Primary 4 ambassadors reaching out to neighbourhood coffee shops.

**Project Buddy Clean:**  
A key environmental project where Primary 5 students are assigned as buddies and facilitators to Primary 3 students. The younger students learn basic cleanliness acts such as mopping the floor from their seniors and each group takes charge of assigned areas in the school such as the classrooms, corridors, hall and canteen. The project focuses on inculcating the right values and practising of social-emotional skills, rather than perfecting the cleaning process. Through the project, the students are offered opportunities to interact with the school cleaners and understand their duties better, thereby deepening their sense of gratitude and appreciation towards a role in school that is commonly taken for granted.

**STAR Programme:**  
Every Marsilian is set to become a responsible learner and compassionate leader, which is why our Primary 4 students have taken the lead to make clean and conducive toilets their responsibility, and at the same time, influence fellow Marsilians to do the same. This is achieved through the decoration of the toilets, making it a welcoming place, thereby promoting ownership.

**Green Citizenship Day @ MPS:**  
A fun-filled day of hands-on activities for all Marsilians to come together to do their part for the environment. Activities include Recycling Art, Book Swap, and making of T-shirt bags. This is also the day when Marsilians demonstrate values in action through litter-picking activities at Woodlands Town Garden – a park adopted by the school, and Project Mail from Gaia – an initiative by our Primary 6 Marsilians to reach out to the community to raise public awareness on environmental conservation.
