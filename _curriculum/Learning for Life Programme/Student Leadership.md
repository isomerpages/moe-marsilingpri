**LEAD (Learn, Engage, Absorb, Demonstrate) to Serve @ MPS**

_Every Marsilian a Service Leader and Green Citizen_

At Marsiling Primary School, we believe that every student can be a leader. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in student leadership is one of the schoolâ€™s key platforms to provide our students with the opportunity to lead and influence others positively. It leverages on service leadership platforms within the Green Citizenship @ MPS and Values-in-Action (VIA) to provide varied and meaningful learning experiences for our students.

**MPS Student Leadership Framework**

The school adopts a 3-tiered approach to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership dimensions of Lead Self, Lead Peers and Lead School and the Community. Student Leadership at Marsiling Primary School is anchored on its school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence, SEL competencies and Growth Mindset Principles.
