<h4><strong>About Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong></h4>
<h4>What is PAL?</h4>
<p>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum
for Primary 1 and 2 students. It offers learning experiences that are active,
hands-on and meaningful. In Marsiling Primary School, all Primary 1 and
2 students undergo PAL modules during school hours and the modules are
spread over the two years.</p>
<h4>Objectives of PAL</h4>
<p>PAL contributes to the development of soft skills in Marsilians such as
the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others which are
important Social and Emotional (SE) competencies. There are platforms for
experiential learning – experimentation, exploration and achieving success.
Opportunities are also provided for Marsilians to go through learning experiences
to acquire a range of skills as well as interact with peers and thereby
developing confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a Marsilian, you will receive broad exposure and experiences through
fun and varied activities in four domains. The modules facilitate holistic
development of pupils in the five domains, that is, moral, cognitive, physical,
social and aesthetics. It also provides varied avenues for Marsilians to
develop social and emotional competencies.</p>

<h4>Visual Arts</h4>
<p>In our visual arts modules, we focus more on exploration, creativity,
and enjoyment rather than the specific artistic goals. Through the various
activities, we encourage out students to explore their creativity and imagination
through art-making. We want our students to develop their observational
skills by encouraging them to closely observe their surroundings and with
the materials they are using.</p>

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Our Primary 1 students are active contributors in the magical world of
rhythm and melody. With an array of musical instruments for exploration
at their fingertips, including body percussion, they embark on a journey
of self-awareness, learning to articulate their inner thoughts and emotions
through the universal language of music. Students are encouraged to unleash
their creativity, pushing the boundaries of traditional music-making to
forge innovative compositions and performances. Amidst the melodies, students
cultivate a profound sense of self-motivation, radiating enthusiasm and
eagerness as they embark on a continuous quest for musical knowledge and
artistic growth.</p>

<h4>Dance and Drama</h4>
<p>Our Primary 1 and 2 students embark on an immersive journey into the world
of performing arts, where they cultivate a profound understanding of self-expression
and collaboration. Through interactive lessons on performance etiquette
and body awareness, students cultivate a heightened sense of presence and
grace, mastering the intricate dance movements that serve as a canvas for
their emotions. Drama is seamlessly woven into their dance journey, enriching
their performances with layers of storytelling and character portrayal
that ignite their imagination and fuel their creativity. As they collaborate
with their peers, students learn the importance of collaboration and collective
effort, working tirelessly to refine their choreography and perfect their
role-play performances. Through this learning process, they develop a sense
of self-motivation, eagerly embracing new challenges with enthusiasm and
determination. United by a shared goal, students demonstrate unwavering
confidence in their abilities and the courage to express themselves authentically,
both on stage and in their interactions with others. Their journey culminates
in a dazzling showcase during the Lower Primary Showcase, where they shine
brightly as they celebrate the joy of their class experiences and the power
of teamwork to bring their artistic visions to life.</p>

<h4>Outdoor Education</h4>
<p>Our Outdoor Education Module aims to equip our Primary 2 students with
the relevant skills and knowledge to enable them to be safe and comfortable
in the outdoors setting. We would also like to help them cultivate a sense
of ownership for the environment, encourage and provide opportunities for
our students to take action to sustain our City in a Garden. We hope to
shape our students’ character and attitudes through experiential learning
in school as part of the module.</p>

<h4>Sports</h4>

each presenting unique challenges that require collaboration and strategic
thinking to overcome. As they overcome the challenges together, they develop
their responsible decision-making skills, cultivate a deepened sense of
self and social awareness. Students are encouraged to innovate, question,
and collaborate toward shared goals. They emerge from each lesson with
a renewed zest for learning and a strengthened commitment to working harmoniously
together.</p>
