The central focus of the Mathematics curriculum is the development of Mathematical problem solving. Supporting this focus are five inter-related components – concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and attitudes.

### **Concrete Pictorial Abstract (C-P-A) Approach**

Learning experiences in the classroom are designed based on the C-P-A approach.

Concrete is the “doing” stage, using concrete objects such as fraction discs, multi-link cubes and base-ten sets to help students understand the concepts.

Pictorial is the “seeing” stage, using representations of the objects to model problems.

Abstract is the “symbolic” stage, where students are able to use symbols to demonstrate understanding of problems.

This approach helps students learn new ideas and build on their existing knowledge by introducing abstract concepts in a more familiar and tangible way.

### **Key Programmes / Activities / Events**

#### STEAM Week

STEAM stands for Science-Technology-Engineering-Arts and Mathematics. The various engaging activities held during STEAM week provided students the opportunity to learn through exploration, sparking invention, innovation and joy of learning and to enthuse students to explore the areas of STEAM.

In alignment with the school’s move towards sustainable living, students collaborated with one another to design toys made from recyclables. In addition, students used their creativity and demonstrated their entrepreneurial dare, taking calculated risks working as a class to complete various timed engineering challenges during recess.

#### **Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme**

The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies, such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.

The programme comprises mathematics curriculum units designed to challenge selected Primary 4 and 5 students and to introduce them to advanced mathematical concepts and thinking.

####  **Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme**

The LSM Programme is designed to provide early intervention support for Primary 1 and 2 students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills. The programme focuses on basic mathematical skills and concepts to consolidate good foundation. It aims to build students’ confidence and positive beliefs about their ability to do Math. The programme is also extended to P3 and P4 students who need to build their foundation skills in Mathematics.

#### **Recess Activities @ Eureka!**

During recess, game stations are set up by our Math subject monitors and teachers at the Eureka, the MTV (Making Thinking Visible) learning space for Math. These Math subject monitors are students who have a passion for the subject, and as an act of service, devote part of their recesses to facilitate the activities ranging from board games to quizzes. As a result, our students experience the joy of learning Math outside the classroom.

#### Math Hero

Math Hero is an in-house program of the Math Department. In this program, Primary 1 to 5 students are given a variety of interesting activities to choose to complete. Some of the activities require the involvement of parents. Upon the completion of each activity, star(s) will be awarded to the students. When a student has earned a stipulated number of stars, a Math Hero button badge and certificate will be awarded to him/her. This program encourages our students to explore Mathematics beyond the textbook and workbook in greater extent of the subject elements through creative problem-solving.
