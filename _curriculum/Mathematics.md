<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Every Marsilian a resilient and joyful problem solver.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>The Mathematics Department aims:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To engage students to think critically and reason clearly in Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster students’ positive attitudes towards the learning of Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable students to appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in real
life.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STEAM Week</h4>
<p>STEAM stands for Science-Technology-Engineering-Arts and Mathematics.
The various engaging activities held during STEAM week provided students
the opportunity to learn through exploration, sparking invention, innovation
and joy of learning and to enthuse students to explore the areas of STEAM.</p>
<p>In alignment with the school’s move towards sustainable living, students
collaborated with one another to design toys made from recyclables. In
addition, students used their creativity and demonstrated their entrepreneurial
dare, taking calculated risks working as a class to complete various timed
engineering challenges during recess.</p>

<h4>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</h4>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to foster independence in mathematical
thinking skills, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies,
such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking,
and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>The programme comprises mathematics curriculum units designed to challenge
selected Primary 4 and 5 students and to introduce them to advanced mathematical
concepts and thinking.</p>

<h4>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</h4>
<p>The LSM Programme is designed to provide early intervention support for
Primary 1 and 2 students who need additional support in acquiring basic
numeracy skills. The programme focuses on basic mathematical skills and
concepts to consolidate good foundation. It aims to build students’ confidence
and positive beliefs about their ability to do Math. The programme is also
extended to P3 and P4 students who need to build their foundation skills
in Mathematics.</p>

<h4>Recess Activities @ Eureka</h4>
<p>Eureka, a Mathematics MTV (Making Things Visible) learning space, is exceptionally
alive during recess. Filled with game booths that put students’ Mathematical
skills to the test, Eureka aims to promote the joy of learning in Mathematics.
The activities range from forming figures using Tangrams, Geoboards and
LEGO pieces to shopping within budget at our life-sized “Mini Mart”.</p>
<p>To ensure recess activities run smoothly, groups of students were selected
and underwent training on the various Mathematics activities. They are
then deployed as Eureka Facilitators to provide immediate assistance to
the participants.</p>

<h4>Math Hero</h4>
<p>Math Hero is an in-house program of the Math Department. In this program,
Primary 1 to 4 students are given a variety of interesting activities to
choose to complete. Some of the activities required them to play a game
with their friends and some require the involvement of family members which
allows meaningful bonding. Upon the completion of each activity, star(s)
will be awarded to the students. When a student has earned a stipulated
number of stars, a Math Hero button badge and certificate will be awarded
to him/her. This program aims to encourage and motivate our students to
take ownership of their own learning.</p>
