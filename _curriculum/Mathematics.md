<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To engage students to think critically and reason clearly in Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster students’ positive attitudes towards the learning of Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable students to appreciate the relevance of Mathematics in real
life.</p>

<p>The central focus of Mathematics curriculum is the development of Mathematical
problem solving. Supporting this focus are five inter-related components
– concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and attitudes.</p>

<h4><strong>Concrete Pictorial Abstract (C-P-A) Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Learning experiences in the classroom are designed based on the C-P-A
approach.</p>
<p>Concrete is the “doing” stage, using concrete objects such as fraction
discs, multi-link cubes and base-ten sets to help students understand the
concepts.</p>
<p>Pictorial is the “seeing” stage, using representations of the objects
to model problems.</p>
<p>Abstract is the “symbolic” stage, where students are able to use symbols
to demonstrate understanding of problems.</p>
<p>This approach helps students learn new ideas and build on their existing
knowledge by introducing abstract concepts in a more familiar and tangible
way.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STEAM@MPS</h4>
<p>STEAM is an interdisciplinary approach to learning that combines Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. A collaborative effort between
the Science and Mathematics department, STEAM@MPS aims to provide students
with the opportunity to learn through exploration, sparking invention,
innovation and joy of learning. The various STEAM activities held throughout
the year is based on the engineering design process. As students brainstorm
ideas, test and iterate solutions based on new information and challenges,
the open-ended environment encourages them to think outside the box, nurturing
different components of 21CC, such as adaptive and critical thinking in
the process. STEAM education equips students with the flexibility and inventiveness
needed to thrive in a constantly evolving world.</p>

<h4>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme</h4>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme is designed by education specialists to
meet the advanced learning needs of Primary 4 and 5 high-achieving learners.
It aims to develop students’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepens
their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will
have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers
and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as games, puzzles,
and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme.</p>
<p>Through the rich learning experiences offered by the programme, students
will develop the attitudes, habits and dispositions mathematicians possess.
They will also gain different components of 21CC such as critical thinking,
invention thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
