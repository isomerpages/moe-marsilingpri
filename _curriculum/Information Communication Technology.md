**Highlights**

The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme is offered to all P6 students. The programme includes learning of computational thinking concepts using visual-based programming language, combining it with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers, to create an engaging coding experience for the students.

The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme aims to:

*   Facilitate the exposure of a large base of students to coding and computational thinking; and
*   Help build an entire generation of workforce inculcated with basic coding and computational thinking skills.
