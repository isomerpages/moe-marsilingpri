<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>Marsiling Art Xperience (MAX)</h4>
<p>In Marsiling Primary School, all students are exposed to different Art
forms throughout the 6 years - drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpting
and digital art. Through the exploration of different media and forms,
students learn and apply the Elements of Art and Principles of Design.
Every art project involves a discussion of an artwork by a selected artist,
followed by the art-making process and finally closing with a gallery walk
and peer critique.</p>

<h4>Art MasterClasses</h4>
<p>The Art MasterClasses is an Art Enrichment Programme for selected students
who show potential in a particular Art form. In 2023, there were 2 MasterClasses
conducted for 2 groups of Primary 4 students, focusing on Watercolour and
Ceramics. From 2024 onwards, with the refresh of the Art Syllabus, MasterClasses
will be conducted for Drawing and Painting, and participants will be selected
students from Primary 3 and 4. These enrichment classes will be held outside
of curriculum hours.</p>

<h4>Museum-Based Learning</h4>
<p>Since 2018, as part of the refreshed Art Syllabus, students will have
the opportunity to visit museums such as the National University of Singapore
(NUS) Museum. This is to make learning more authentic and also to expose
students to Singaporean Art. Primary 4 students are involved in this programme.
They would learn how to respond to artworks using Thinking Routines such
as See-Think-Wonder.</p>
