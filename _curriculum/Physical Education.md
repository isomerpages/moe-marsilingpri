###### **P6 Archery**

Archery is a great sport for boosting students' mental and physical health and fitness. Archers require not only physical strength, but they will also need mental fitness and archers develop their focus, flexibility and attention skills.

The sport can be extremely dangerous if students are reckless. Archery teaches everyone to be responsible for one another and be responsible for the equipment they are use.
