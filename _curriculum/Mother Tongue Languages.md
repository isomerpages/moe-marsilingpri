<h4>Mother Tongue Reading Programme</h4>
<p>The Mother Tongue Reading program is designed to cultivate a passion for
reading among students. Reading sessions take place during Mother Tongue
lessons and students are encouraged to continue reading during school holidays.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To enhance comprehension and communication skills, the program integrates
various Making Thinking Visible (MTV) routines. These routines help students
delve deeper into the stories and articulate their thoughts effectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moreover, the Reading Program synergizes with the Writing Program, underlining
our belief that reading inspires writing. At year-end, in collaboration
with the English department, the Mother Tongue department compiles selected
students' works into a school publication. This publication then serves
as a valuable teaching and learning resource moving forward.</p>
