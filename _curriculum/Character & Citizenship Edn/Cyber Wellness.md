<h4><strong>About Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong></h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to&nbsp;the positive well-being of Internet
users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of
how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping
students to become responsible digital learners.</p>
<p>When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self
and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also
be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration,
learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology
for the good of the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are the key messages which students will understand:</p>

<p>Cyber Wellness in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on
the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum
aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power
of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
and be safe and responsible users of ICT.</p>
<p>MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and
empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.
The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible
Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s
well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered
decisions.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>Cyber Wellness Awareness Week</h4>
<p>The Cyber Wellness (CW) Awareness Week was conducted in conjunction with
the TDD week in Term 1. During the CW Awareness Week, students get to visit
the CW game booths during recesses to learn more about Cyber Wellness and
Cyber Security. This is in line with the Digital Defence, one of the six
Total Defence pillars.</p>
