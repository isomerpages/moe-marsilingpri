<h4><strong>About Cyber Wellness</strong></h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to&nbsp;the positive well-being of Internet
users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of
how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping
students to become responsible digital learners.</p>
<p>When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self
and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also
be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration,
learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology
for the good of the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are the key messages which students will understand:</p>
