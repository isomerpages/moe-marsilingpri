GeM@MPS aims to develop our Marsilians into confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens in line with our school’s mission where we hope to nurture our Marsilians into **_Resilient Learners and Confident Leaders_** of tomorrow.

To help us increase the awareness on growth mindset, we conceptualized the 3 GM mascots and 6 GM messages in 2018. It was a collaborative effort from our students and teachers in coming up with the names for our 3 mascots. The whole school went through a voting process to help us select the names for our GM mascots. So, who are they?
