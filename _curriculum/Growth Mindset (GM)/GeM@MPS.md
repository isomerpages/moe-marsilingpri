#### GeM@MPS

Growth Mindset @ MPS or GeM@MPS is a whole-school approach adopted since 2017 to raise our students’ attainment and motivation. It aims to foster a culture of care and excellence in the school and nurture students’ inner drive to succeed, through deliberate efforts to build a growth mindset (GM), an affirmative teacher-student relationships (TSR) and peer support and relationships (PSR).

#### What is Growth Mindset?

World-renowned Stanford University psychologist and one of the world’s leading researchers in the field of psychology and motivation, Carol Dweck, has discovered the power of our mindset. She believes that having the right mindset is key to helping students attain success and motivation. In her research, she discussed about 2 types of mindsets – the growth mindset and fixed mindset. She learned that people with a fixed mindset avoid challenges, give up easily, see effort as fruitless, ignore useful negative feedback and feel threatened by the success of others. Whereas, those with a growth mindset tend to have the ability to embrace challenges, persists in the face of setbacks, see effort as a path to mastery, learn from criticism and are inspired by the successes of others.

Her work on mindsets has inspired us to embark on a journey to learn more about growth mindset. Her self-theories or incremental theory has shown us that the brain is far more malleable than we ever knew.

#### GM Mascots and Messages

GeM@MPS aims to develop our Marsilians into confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens in line with our school’s mission where we hope to nurture our Marsilians into **_Resilient Learners and Confident Leaders_** of tomorrow.

To help us increase the awareness on growth mindset, we conceptualized the 3 GM mascots and 6 GM messages in 2018. It was a collaborative effort from our students and teachers in coming up with the names for our 3 mascots. The whole school went through a voting process to help us select the names for our GM mascots. So, who are they?

Our GM Mascots, in particular, Sparkle and Ray, who are both advocators of Growth Mindset, have been helping us to spread the 6 GM Messages to the students since 2018. What are the 6 GM Messages?

#### Nurturing Growth Mindset in Marsilians

 In MPS, our Marsilians go through the Growth Mindset curriculum during FTGP once every term, where they learn about growth and fixed mindsets. They learn about brain neuroplasticity to understand how to strengthen their brain muscles through persistent practice by learning new skills and forming good habits. To strengthen their resilience in coping with challenges and difficult situations, they learn how to use the S.T.A.R strategy to guide them in making responsible decisions and engage them in personal reflection to build their self efficacy and personal responsibility.

#### Creating a Caring and Enabling School Environment

We saw the potential of using GM as a key enabler to uplift our students and help every child believe that he can achieve his fullest potential. Our belief was simple yet powerful – the explicit teaching of GM and building of affirmative relationships would impact student motivation and achievement. GeM@MPS promotes a common language and visible GM culture that focuses on building resilience and encourages positive interactions between students-teachers, students-students and students-parents. When all members of the school community articulate the same belief that every student can succeed, we make GM visible and provide a healthy ecosystem that allows the student to thrive and succeed.

#### Making GM Visible
 
We made our mascots into standees and banners and display them around the school to make the GM mascots and messages visible to all our students. This has helped in promoting consistent messaging and a common GM language amongst teachers and students. The GM messages and mascots are pervasively infused into teaching and learning, to constantly remind students to apply GM in whatever they do. The mascots unite the students, make everyone feel included, and connect students to one another and to the school.

#### The GM Experience @ MPS

The school creates several platforms for our students to apply the GM messages what they do. The GM messages, together with our school values of RRRICE (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence) are what guide our students in developing the good habits, values and dispositions to be Resilient Learners and Confident Leaders of tomorrow. These are some key programmes designed for all our Marsilians. They find joy in the learning and are able to participate actively in these programmes.
