**LEAD (Learn, Engage, Absorb, Demonstrate) to Serve @ MPS**

_Every Marsilian a Service Leader and Green Citizen_

At Marsiling Primary School, we believe that every student can be a leader. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in student leadership is one of the school’s key platforms to provide our students with the opportunity to lead and influence others positively. It leverages on service leadership platforms within the Green Citizenship @ MPS and Values-in-Action (VIA) to provide varied and meaningful learning experiences for our students.

**MPS Student Leadership Framework**

The school adopts a 3-tiered approach to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership dimensions of Lead Self, Lead Peers and Lead School and the Community. Student Leadership at Marsiling Primary School is anchored on its school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Excellence, SEL competencies and Growth Mindset Principles.

**Tier 1: Self Leadership**

All P1 to P6 students will go through a 6-year leadership developmental programme.

* At P1 and P2, the students will learn about Self-Leadership - how they will take the lead to manage themselves as leaders.

* At P3 and P4, the students will learn about Peer Leadership – how to manage their relationships with peers, teachers or families.

* At P5 and P6, the focus will be on Community Leadership – what community leadership is about and how they can contribute as Service Leaders and Green Citizens.

* Different levels will be involved in different Green Citizenship activities and VIA activities to hone their skills as a leader.

**Tier 2: Class Level Leadership (Class Committee, Peer Support Leaders)**

* Class Committee members are nominated by their form teachers and are rotated every semester to provide more opportunities for Marsilians to serve.

* Class Committee members are engaged in role-specific trainings to equip them with the skills and knowledge to manage their duties in class.

* The classroom setting serves as a platform for P1 to P6 students to practise their leadership skills and for the identification of students with strong leadership potential to take on the roles in the next tier.
