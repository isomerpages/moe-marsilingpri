<h4>Student Leaders’ Investiture 2024</h4>

leaders into their roles for the year and show the school’s commitment
to developing student leaders. On 5 February 2024, a total of 63 Prefects
and 30 CCA Leaders were appointed into their roles. As the school’s Tier

the school and the community.</p>

<h4>Reduce @ North West: A Collaboration with North West CDC</h4>
<p>The school collaborated with North West CDC to conduct door-to-door visits
to educate residents on the conservation of energy and water at home and
encourage their participation in the programme. Our P5 and P6 student leaders

CDC to learn about the importance of climate change, reduction on food
waste and provide tips on energy and water conservation before the outreach.</p>

<h4>Friend of Singa (FOS) Programme</h4>
<p>Our P4 student leaders led in a kindness project titled ‘Caring Connections’
at Marsiling Primary School where they strive to nurture a culture of giving
and gratitude and building stronger bonds within the school community.
The project kickstarted with a pre-assembly talk to introduce Kindness
Week to the school.&nbsp; Activities such as interactive video sessions,
discussions on kindness, crafting personalised gifts and playing board
games created by the leaders on Kindness were carried out during the Kindness
Week. In addition, students also penned messages of appreciation that were
read out in the canteen and took part in poster colouring and design competitions.</p>
