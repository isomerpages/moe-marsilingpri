<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STAR Project</h4>
<p>As advocates for clean toilets, our P4 students are tasked to spread the
awareness of being a responsible toilet users. As leaders, they take the
lead to be role models to their peers and families on the importance of
respecting the toilet environment by keeping it clean. In addition, through
this project, the students will learn to appreciate what our toilet janitors
do in their daily work in keeping our toilets clean. As advocates for clean
toilets, each Primary 4 class designed an activity to promote good toilet
habits. Some of the activities include a pre-assembly sharing to raise
awareness, skits to promote good toilet habits, toilet pledges and jingles.</p>

<h4>Marsiling Cleans Up</h4>
<p>As part of the Values-In-Action Programme for Primary 6 students, the
school organizes a litter picking activity to provide our students with
the opportunity to play their part in keeping Singapore litter free and
to appreciate the hard work of our cleaners. The activity begins from Marsiling
Primary School and ends at Woodlands Waterfront park with the classes taking
on different designated routes.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Project Recyclables</h4>
<p>Project Recyclables is an annual project which our graduating classes
embark as their final act as a Green Citizen of Marsiling Primary School.
Through this project, students will understand how waste reduction and
effective waste management impacts the environment, recycle the recyclables
collected from the school community and be inspired and inspire others
to make waste reduction a habit.</p>
