<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>STAR Project</h4>
<p>As advocates for clean toilets, our P4 students are tasked to spread the
awareness of being a responsible toilet users. As leaders, they take the
lead to be role models to their peers and families on the importance of
respecting the toilet environment by keeping it clean. In addition, through
this project, the students will learn to appreciate what our toilet janitors
do in their daily work in keeping our toilets clean. As advocates for clean
toilets, each Primary 4 class designed an activity to promote good toilet
habits. Some of the activities include a pre-assembly sharing to raise
awareness, skits to promote good toilet habits, toilet pledges and jingles.</p>
