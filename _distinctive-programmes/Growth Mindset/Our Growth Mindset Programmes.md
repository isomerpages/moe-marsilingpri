<h4>Sparkle and Ray Award</h4>
<p>The Sparkle and Ray Award was conceptualized in 2021 to recognize students
who demonstrate the school values and practice the GM messages consistently.
They are nominated by their Form Teachers for this award every semester.
These students serve as good role models to others and are able to positively
influence their peers in doing the right.</p>

<h4>Story Challenge Competition</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>
</p>
<p>The primary aim of the Story Challenge Competition is to encourage students
to reflect on and share their experiences of applying or demonstrating
the school values RRRICE (Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity,
Care, and Empathy) and Growth Mindset messages in their lives. This objective
aligns with fostering a positive school culture and character development
among students.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>
</p>
<p>Offering students the choice to submit their stories either in photo images
with a write-up or through video commentary provides flexibility and accommodates
diverse student preferences. This inclusive approach enhances student engagement
and participation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong>
</p>
<p>Hosting the competition on the Students Learning Space (SLS) leverages
technology effectively, making it convenient for students to submit their
entries. Integrating technology into the initiative reflects a contemporary
approach to education and encourages digital literacy skills among students.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong>
</p>
<p>Recognisng and showcasing the best story submissions during morning pre-assemblies
serves multiple purposes. It not only acknowledges the winners but also
amplifies their stories to the entire school community, fostering a sense
of pride and inspiration among students. Additionally, highlighting exemplary
behavior and character traits reinforces positive values school-wide.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Peer Influence and Support</strong>
</p>
<p>The initiative's unintended yet positive outcome of strengthening peer
support structures through peer influencing is commendable. By sharing
stories of peers who exemplify desired character traits, students are more
likely to be inspired and motivated to emulate similar behaviors, thereby
creating a culture of mutual support and encouragement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>
</p>
<p>Regularly selecting winners and sharing their stories every semester allows
for ongoing reinforcement of positive behaviors and provides opportunities
for continuous improvement in the initiative itself based on feedback and
evaluation.</p>
<p>Overall, the Story Challenge Competition appears to be a valuable initiative
that not only promotes the school's values and messages but also cultivates
a supportive and resilient school community.</p>
<p>As part of our continued efforts to build mental resilience and good character
in our students, we designed the Story Challenge Competition to create
an avenue for our students to share their voices and their stories on how
they applied or demonstrate the school values RRRICE and Growth Mindset
messages in their lives. The competition is posted on the Students Learning
Space (SLS) to provide students an opportunity to tap on technology to
submit their stories. They have a choice to submit their stories in photo
images with a write up or a video with their commentary. The best story
submissions are selected every semester and shared during morning pre-assemblies
as a for of recognition of the winners as well as to allow the rest of
the school to hear these good stories and emulate the good character from
their peers. We realized that this initiative also helped to strengthen
peer support structures through peer influencing.</p>

<h4>I am a Good Marsilian (IAAGM)</h4>
<p>Your IAAGM (I Am A Good Marsilian) program seems to be a well-structured
initiative aimed at fostering the consistent practice of school values
and Growth Mindset (GM) among students, both within the school environment
and at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The IAAGM program complements the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum by reinforcing the explicit
teaching of school values and GM to students. This alignment ensures continuity
and reinforcement of these important concepts across different learning
contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reflective Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>The activities provided in the IAAGM booklets offer students opportunities
for reflection on their learning from the CCE MTL curriculum. By engaging
in reflection, students deepen their understanding of the values and GM
principles and internalize them more effectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Application in Daily Life</strong>
</p>
<p>Encouraging students to apply the learned values and GM in various aspects
of their lives, including interactions with peers, teachers, and family
members, is a commendable aspect of the program. This approach emphasizes
the practical relevance of these concepts beyond the classroom, promoting
their integration into students' everyday behaviors and attitudes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Holistic Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>By encouraging students to practice school values and GM not only within
the school setting but also at home, the IAAGM program adopts a holistic
approach to character education. Recognizing the influence of family dynamics
on students' character development reinforces the importance of collaboration
between school and home environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IAAGM program promotes the consistent application of school values
and GM principles, contributing to students' overall growth and development
as responsible and principled individuals.</p>
