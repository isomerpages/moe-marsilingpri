<h4><strong>Our Growth Mindset (GM) Programmes</strong></h4>
<h4>Sparkle and Ray Award</h4>
<p>The Sparkle and Ray Award was conceptualized in 2021 to recognize students
who demonstrate the school values and practice the GM messages consistently.
They are nominated by their Form Teachers for this award every semester.
These students serve as good role models to others and are able to positively
influence their peers in doing the right.</p>

<h4>Story Challenge Competition</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>
</p>
<p>The primary aim of the Story Challenge Competition is to encourage students
to reflect on and share their experiences of applying or demonstrating
the school values RRRICE (Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity,
Care, and Empathy) and Growth Mindset messages in their lives. This objective
aligns with fostering a positive school culture and character development
among students.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong>
</p>
<p>Offering students the choice to submit their stories either in photo images
with a write-up or through video commentary provides flexibility and accommodates
diverse student preferences. This inclusive approach enhances student engagement
and participation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Platform</strong>
</p>
<p>Hosting the competition on the Students Learning Space (SLS) leverages
technology effectively, making it convenient for students to submit their
entries. Integrating technology into the initiative reflects a contemporary
approach to education and encourages digital literacy skills among students.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong>
</p>
<p>Recognisng and showcasing the best story submissions during morning pre-assemblies
serves multiple purposes. It not only acknowledges the winners but also
amplifies their stories to the entire school community, fostering a sense
of pride and inspiration among students. Additionally, highlighting exemplary
behavior and character traits reinforces positive values school-wide.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Peer Influence and Support</strong>
</p>
<p>The initiative's unintended yet positive outcome of strengthening peer
support structures through peer influencing is commendable. By sharing
stories of peers who exemplify desired character traits, students are more
likely to be inspired and motivated to emulate similar behaviors, thereby
creating a culture of mutual support and encouragement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>
</p>
<p>Regularly selecting winners and sharing their stories every semester allows
for ongoing reinforcement of positive behaviors and provides opportunities
for continuous improvement in the initiative itself based on feedback and
evaluation.</p>
<p>Overall, the Story Challenge Competition appears to be a valuable initiative
that not only promotes the school's values and messages but also cultivates
a supportive and resilient school community.</p>

<h4>Caught Doing Good! (CDG)</h4>
<p>Our Caught Doing Good (CDG) program is an initiative that aims to recognize
and affirm students who demonstrate positive behavior and actions that
align with the school's values and Growth Mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition of Positive Behavior</strong>: The CDG program acknowledges
students who engage in acts of kindness or responsible behavior, such as
engaging in silent reading without being prompted or returning lost items
to the general office. By publicly recognizing these actions, the program
reinforces the importance of such behavior within the school community.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Peer Support Structures</strong>: The program's
focus on strengthening peer support structures and relationships among
students is a significant aspect. By highlighting examples of positive
behavior, the CDG program encourages students to support and uplift one
another, fostering a culture of mutual respect and kindness.</p>
<p><strong>Peer Influence for Positive Behavior</strong>: The CDG program
recognizes that students have the potential to positively influence their
peers. By showcasing examples of good deeds and responsible actions, the
program inspires other students to follow suit, creating a ripple effect
of positive behavior throughout the school community.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion of Personal Responsibility</strong>: Encouraging students
to engage in positive actions not only for others but also for themselves
reinforces the importance of personal responsibility and self-awareness.
This aspect of the program encourages students to consider the impact of
their behavior on themselves as well as on their peers and the wider school
community.</p>
<p>The Caught Doing Good program promotes a positive school culture and fosters
a sense of community among students. By recognizing and affirming positive
behavior, the program reinforces the school's values and encourages students
to contribute to a supportive and respectful learning environment.</p>

<h4>I am a Good Marsilian (IAAGM)</h4>
<p>Your IAAGM (I Am A Good Marsilian) program seems to be a well-structured
initiative aimed at fostering the consistent practice of school values
and Growth Mindset (GM) among students, both within the school environment
and at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Alignment with Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>The IAAGM program complements the Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum by reinforcing the explicit
teaching of school values and GM to students. This alignment ensures continuity
and reinforcement of these important concepts across different learning
contexts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Reflective Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>The activities provided in the IAAGM booklets offer students opportunities
for reflection on their learning from the CCE MTL curriculum. By engaging
in reflection, students deepen their understanding of the values and GM
principles and internalize them more effectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Application in Daily Life</strong>
</p>
<p>Encouraging students to apply the learned values and GM in various aspects
of their lives, including interactions with peers, teachers, and family
members, is a commendable aspect of the program. This approach emphasizes
the practical relevance of these concepts beyond the classroom, promoting
their integration into students' everyday behaviors and attitudes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Holistic Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>By encouraging students to practice school values and GM not only within
the school setting but also at home, the IAAGM program adopts a holistic
approach to character education. Recognizing the influence of family dynamics
on students' character development reinforces the importance of collaboration
between school and home environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IAAGM program promotes the consistent application of school values
and GM principles, contributing to students' overall growth and development
as responsible and principled individuals.</p>
