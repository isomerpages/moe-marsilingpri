<h4><strong>Our Growth Mindset (GM) Mascots</strong></h4>
<p>In 2017, Sparkle and Ray were carefully curated as our Growth Mindset
mascots to visually represent the six key messages of Growth Mindset (GM)
and our school values embodied by RRRICE (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience,
Integrity, Care, Excellence). These vibrant characters personify GM, showcasing
traits such as resilience, adaptability, and a positive attitude.</p>
<p>The mascots are prominently featured in banners and posters throughout
the school, serving to promote a growth mindset language and reinforce
the application of our school values. These visual aids are strategically
displayed around the school to create an enabling and caring environment,
encouraging students to embody the principles of GM and RRRICE in their
daily lives.</p>
<p>By integrating Sparkle and Ray into our school community, we strive to
cultivate a GM culture where students are motivated to embrace challenges,
persevere in the face of obstacles, and consistently seek improvement.
Since their introduction, Sparkle and Ray have become cherished symbols
within our school, enhancing our visual identity and reinforcing our dedication
to fostering a growth-oriented mindset among our students through their
daily application and practice of the six growth mindset messages in their
lives.</p>

developed by learning a new skill. She realizes that, when learning something
new, it may seem difficult at first but she never gives up. She believes

she becomes good at it.</p>

<p>Ray is like the sunlight that brightens up other people’s day. When he
is down, or feeling disappointed, he will look at the bright side of things
and think of helpful ways to overcome the challenges he faced. Like Sparkle,
he also has resilience and grit. He will learn from his mistakes and keep
an open mind to new ideas and possibilities.</p>
