<h4>Growth Mindset (GM) Mascots Standees</h4>

the students back at the beginning at each term. They also carry key messages
and reminders on our school values and GM Messages as visual reminders
for the students.</p>

<h4>GM Messages Banners</h4>
<p>The mascots are prominently featured in banners and posters throughout
the school, serving to promote a growth mindset language and reinforce
the application of our school values. These visual aids are strategically
displayed around the school to create an enabling and caring environment,
encouraging students to embody the principles of GM and RRRICE in their
daily lives.</p>

<h4>S.T.A.R. Strategy Wall Mural</h4>
<p>In MPS, our Marsilians go through the Growth Mindset curriculum during
FTGP once every term, where they learn about growth and fixed mindsets.
They learn about brain neuroplasticity to understand how to strengthen
their brain muscles through persistent practice by learning new skills
and forming good habits. To strengthen their resilience in coping with
challenges and difficult situations, they learn how to use the S.T.A.R
strategy to guide them in making responsible decisions and engage them
in personal reflection to build their self efficacy and personal responsibility.</p>
