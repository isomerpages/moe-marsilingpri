In MPS, our Marsilians go through the Growth Mindset curriculum during FTGP once every term, where they learn about growth and fixed mindsets. They learn about brain neuroplasticity to understand how to strengthen their brain muscles through persistent practice by learning new skills and forming good habits. To strengthen their resilience in coping with challenges and difficult situations, they learn how to use the S.T.A.R strategy to guide them in making responsible decisions and engage them in personal reflection to build their self efficacy and personal responsibility.
