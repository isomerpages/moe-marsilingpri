<p><strong>Take 5!</strong>
</p>
<p>Take 5! is a five-minute break at mid-day that allows students to re-energise,
have a snack and practise self-leadership. Students are encouraged to bring
a healthy snack, such as bread, biscuits or fruits, to eat in class during
Take 5! Our Marsilians will be taught how to choose healthy snacks during
their Physical Health Education (PHE) lessons.</p>
