The Marsiling Experience aims to offer our students a broad range of learning experiences that will help them to discover their talents and interests. Here, we will highlight some pogrammes that our lower primary students will go through in their first two years with us.

Our P1 and P2 students participate in many English Language activities. One of them is the Choral Reading and Reader’s Theatre during EL Fiesta. Primary 1 students are involved in Choral Reading Competition while Primary 2 students are involved in Reader’s Theatre. We also conduct group activities and learning journey during our English lessons.
