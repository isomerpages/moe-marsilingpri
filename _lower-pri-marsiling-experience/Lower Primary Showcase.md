To provide an opportunity for our Primary 1 and 2 students to develop confidence and apply their learning, the school organises the 3-part Lower Primary Showcase.  
  
<u>Lower Primary Games:</u>  
The Lower Primary Games is an excellent opportunity for our Lower Primary students to display the skills that they have acquired during their Physical Education lessons (e.g. sportsmanship and teamwork).  
  

<u>Lower Primary Exhibition:</u>  
Students will present their reflections on the learning experiences they had in English Language, Mathematics, Mother Tongue Language, Music and Art

  

<u>Lower Primary Spotlight:</u>  
Students will showcase what they have learned in Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and work in groups to perform a simple dance choreography. The P1 Ethnic Dance module exposes students to specific dance moves of at least three different ethnic groups, while the P2 Hip Hop Dance module exposes students to different hip hop dance moves.
