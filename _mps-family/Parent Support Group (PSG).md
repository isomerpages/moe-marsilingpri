<h4><strong>About PSG</strong></h4>
<p>MPS PSG serves as a fundamental complement to the school, supporting and
strengthening the school’s programmes to improve our children’s holistic
development and learning.</p>
<p>We work together with the school to help organise and facilitate enriching
and enjoyable learning experiences for our children. These activities are
often held during the recess time, aligning with the school-based events
such as Chinese New Year, International Friendship Day, Earth Week, and
Children’s Day. These events are packed with an array of engaging activities
which include interactive games, and hands-on crafts.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>PSG Events</strong></h4>
<h4>Chinese New Year Activities</h4>
<p>PSG greatly enriched the Chinese New Year recess activities by ensuring
smooth operations and creating an engaging environment for students to
explore traditions. Through cultural demonstrations, PSG enriched students'
understanding of Chinese culture. Our dedication significantly enhanced
the educational value of the event, fostering a deeper appreciation for
Chinese New Year customs among students.</p>

<h4>Total Defence Day Activities</h4>
<p>During Total Defence Day recess activities, PSG members inspired students
to engage fully in activities and discussions related to national defence,
fostering a sense of enthusiasm and civic responsibility. PSG's support
created a dynamic learning environment that empowers students to understand
and value Total Defence principles.</p>
