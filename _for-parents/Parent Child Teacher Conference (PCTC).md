In Marsiling Primary School, each child leads his/ her teachers and parents in a three-way conferencing model during the PCTC, demonstrating a learned skill or reflecting his/ her learning using the presentation skills taught in class. Parents can see for themselves what their child has learnt in school. The teachers facilitate the conference by guiding the child with questions and share the child’s holistic development with the parents. Parents support the conference by affirming the child’s effort and progress, asking questions and seeking advice from the teachers to better support their child.  
  
This three-way conferencing model strongly reinforces our intention to develop Marsilians to be confident and self-directed learners and build strong partnership among our parents, teachers and students.


The PCTC session is an opportunity for parents, students and teachers to interact and dialogue about the child’s progress in Semester 1. It aims to: (i) strengthen parent-child bonding, (ii) give you a fuller understanding of what and how your child has learnt, and (iii) provide a platform for students to share highlights of their learning experience in school. Students are active participants of the PCTC as they share with their parents their learning experiences in Semester 1.![](/images/LP%20MPS%20Experience/PCTC%202.jpeg)
