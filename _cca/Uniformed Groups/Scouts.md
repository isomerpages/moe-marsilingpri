<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>ADIJI Chief Scout</h4>
<p>On March 2, 2024, our Cub Scouts from P4 to P6 joined 4000 other scouts
at Choa Chu Kang Stadium to welcome President Tharman Shamugaratnam as
Chief Scout. Our Cub Scouts hosted an engaging educational booth where
visitors learned how to fold various paper planes. The booth received a
positive reception, making it a memorable occasion for our Cub Scouts.</p>
