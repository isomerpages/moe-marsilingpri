<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>World Thinking Day Celebrations</h4>
<p>Our Brownies took part in the Girl Guides World Thinking Day 2024 event
held at One Tampines Hub. In partnership with Raffles Girls' School, our
Brownies established an interactive booth aimed at educating visitors on
stress management techniques. Our booth demonstrated how to create water
bead stress balls as a means of coping with stress.</p>
<p>In addition, our Brownies reaffirm their commitment to the Guide Laws
by renewing their promise in front of the whole school.</p>

<h4>National Day Observance Ceremony</h4>
<p>Always present during the National Day Observance Ceremony, our Brownies,
alongside the Scouts, lead the procession for the flag-raising segment.
They carry the flag, bringing it to the flagpoles, and raise it while the
national anthem and school song are sung.</p>
