<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>Total Defence Day (TDD) Skit 2024</h4>
<p>Our members put up a skit for this year’s Total Defence Day which was
showcased to the whole school during the TDD assembly programme. The skit
evolved around the 6<sup>th</sup> pillar of Total Defence – Digital Defence.
Our members had the opportunity to showcase the skills that they had learnt
during the CCA sessions and it was a great experience for them.</p>
