<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>Speak Good English Movement</h4>
<p>To educate Marsilians on speaking good English, the MPS Speech and Drama
Club began a storyboarding journey. Members used a story plot to plan camera
angles, select props, and script dialogues for each scene. They also drew
up sketches of how the scenes would look like in their storyboard templates.
After the storyboards were completed, some members took up the roles of
filming the scenes, editing and adding in subtitles for the skit.</p>

<h4>Total Defence Day (TDD) Skit 2024</h4>
<p>Our members put up a skit for this year’s Total Defence Day which was
showcased to the whole school during the TDD assembly programme. The skit
evolved around the 6<sup>th</sup> pillar of Total Defence – Digital Defence.
Our members had the opportunity to showcase the skills that they had learnt
during the CCA sessions and it was a great experience for them.</p>
