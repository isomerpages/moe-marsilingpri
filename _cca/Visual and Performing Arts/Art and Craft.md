<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>N5 Cluster Art Exhibition 2024</h4>
<p>Members of the CCA represented the school in the recent N5 Cluster Art
Exhibition held from 6 May to 1 July. Themed "CONNECTIONS", it delved into
the profound impact of identity, relationships, and choice on our global
citizenship. Using Google Maps, the students traced out the daily route
they took from home to school. The lines were then expanded into artwork
using the Assembly app. All the routes were consolidated into one image,
reminding the students of how they are all connected for the love of Art.</p>
