<h4><strong>About Chinese Dance</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Chinese Dance is an appreciation of aesthetics. Students will learn
basic coordination, rhythm, and flexibility. Dancers will develop leadership
skills and confidence to guide juniors and perform in public. Most importantly,
they will learn to work together as a team.</p>
