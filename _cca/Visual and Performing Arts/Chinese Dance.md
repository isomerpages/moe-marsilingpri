<h4><strong>About Chinese Dance</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Chinese Dance is a dynamic and inclusive CCA dedicated to the art
of dance. Students will learn basic coordination skills, dance techniques
and improve their flexibility. Dancers will develop leadership skills and
confidence as they guide their juniors and perform in public. Most importantly,
they foster both personal growth and a sense of camaraderie.</p>
<p>Besides that, the CCA aims to provide an opportunity for students to pursue
Performing Arts in secondary school through Direct School Admission (DSA).
Over the years, there have been at least 4 successful applicants who continued
to develop their talents and passion in schools such as ST Margaret’s Secondary
School, Woodlands Riverside Secondary School and Woodlands Ring Secondary
School.</p>
