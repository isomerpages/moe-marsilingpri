<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>Showcasing of talents and skills</h4>
<p>MPS Malay Dance members not only have the opportunity to showcase their

performances, such as the National Day Dinner organized by Marsiling Community
Club, provides them with exposure to diverse audiences and further hones
their performance abilities, contributing to their overall personal and
artistic development.</p>
