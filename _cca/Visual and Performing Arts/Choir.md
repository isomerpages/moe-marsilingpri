<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>Voices of Singapore Festival</h4>
<p>The MPS Choir participated in the Voices of Singapore Festival, Singapore's
largest non-competitive choral festival. In the lasting allure of the CHIJMES
Hall, our Choir members sang their hearts out. As part of the festival,
they also interacted with other primary school Choirs at the Choral Exchange.
It was a memorable music-making experience for the Choir.</p>
