<h4><strong>About Choir</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Choir aims to equip members with good singing techniques. Students
learn to have strong breath support and pitch accurately for harmonization.
They also pick up musicianship and stage presentation skills. Students
are exposed to a range of repertoire and have various opportunities for
performances in and out of school.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CCA aims to provide a pathway for students to pursue
Performing Arts in secondary school through Direct School Admission (DSA).
Over the years, successful applicants have been able to sustain their passion
for singing in schools such as Chung Cheng High School and Swiss Cottage
Secondary School.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>Voices of Singapore Festival</h4>
<p>The MPS Choir participated in the annual Voices of Singapore Festival,
Singapore's largest non-competitive choral festival. The festival aims
to create meaningful choral music-making experiences for all its participants
and performers. Other than performing, our students also interacted with
other primary school Choirs at the Choral Exchange. It was a memorable
music-making experience for the Choir.</p>
