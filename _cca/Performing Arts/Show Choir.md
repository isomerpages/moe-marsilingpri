MPS Show Choir aims to equip members with good singing skills and dance techniques. Members are exposed to a range of repertoire and have various opportunities for performances in and out of school. Members will also have the opportunity to go on a Learning Journey to performing arts centres such as the Esplanade to enjoy performances together.
