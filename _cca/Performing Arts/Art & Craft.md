The Art & Craft Club has a 4-year plan, such that at the end of Year 4, students would have developed their skills in drawing, painting and craftwork. Students will be able to apply elements of art and principles of design in their artwork. They will also be able to present their artwork confidently and appreciate others ‘artwork as well. Eventually they will be able to produce creative and quality artwork which can be sent for competitions.
