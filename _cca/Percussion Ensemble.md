MPS Percussion Ensemble, previously known as Drumz was introduced in Marsiling Primary School in 2010. Students will learn various percussion instruments such as snare drums, toms toms and African djembes. MPS Percussion Ensemble team was identified and invited to perform for SYF Celebrations at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre in 2018 and they were mentored by the renowned Singapore Percussion Group Sambiesta. Selected students were trained to co-perform with professional percussionists during this event which was held on 2 July 2018. MPS Percussion Ensemble has performed for various events inside and outside of school (E.g. Marsiling CC NDD and NDOC) and the students always look forward to these platforms when they can showcase their talents and teamwork.
