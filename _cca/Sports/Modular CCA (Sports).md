<h4><strong>About Modular Sports</strong></h4>
<p>In Modular Sports, our main aim is for students to love and appreciate
the sport, and to be able to acquire skills that will allow them to play
with their friends and family members in their free time. The students
learn the basic skills, stroke and footwork of Badminton.
<br>Friendly matches are conducted internally to provide the students with
the opportunity to apply what they learnt during CCA. With dedication,
discipline, and a willingness to learn and adapt, students develop a resilient
mindset through the CCA.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>Weekly fun-filled matches</h4>
<p>Badminton friendly matches are informal, non-competitive games played
by our members during the CCA sessions. These matches typically prioritize
enjoyment, camaraderie, and skill development over intense competition
and winning. They provide an opportunity for players of varying skill levels
to come together and engage in the sport in a relaxed atmosphere. Friendly
matches are an excellent way our players stay active, hone their skills,
and socialize with peers who share a passion for badminton.</p>
