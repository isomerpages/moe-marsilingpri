<p>Track and Field has always been a popular CCA in Marsiling Primary School. During the training sessions, the athletes are divided into groups to do drills to develop their athletics skills. They are also trained to do high jump, long jump, shot put and baton passing. Through the CCA, the athletes will be able to develop social skills, team building, perseverance, hard work and character building. With the knowledge acquired as well as the skills and values learnt, they will develop the passion for the sport, take it up as a healthy hobby in future and become sportsmen of integrity.</p><p>Those with potential will be selected to represent the school in the National School Games Track and Field Championship to give them the exposure to competitive sports, allowing them to enjoy their sporting experiences and apply the skill set acquired.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers-in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Time</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Chin Thian Soong (I/C)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>School Field</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Tuesday, 3.15pm-4.45pm</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Ong Kai Ling (2nd I/C)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>ISH Level 1/3 (Wet Weather)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Lee Chun Hua</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Su Haojing</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tf1000.jpg"></div><p>!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tf2000.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tf3000.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tf4000.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tf5000.jpg"></div><p></p>
