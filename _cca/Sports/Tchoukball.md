<p><strong>Tchoukball</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tchoukball&nbsp;is a non-contact indoor team sport. Its name resembles
the sound - ‘tchouk’ - that's produced when the ball hits the frame. It
is fast-paced ball game where players are required to jump, throw and catch
balls, as well as run around the court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our training sessions are held regularly by an external coach to prepare
our teams for the annual Inter-School Tchoukball Championships. During
training, our boys and girls persevere and embrace challenges even when
training gets tough.</p>
