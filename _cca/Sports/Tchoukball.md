<h4><strong>Tchoukball</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Tchoukball&nbsp;is a non-contact indoor team sport. Its name resembles
the sound - ‘tchouk’ - that's produced when the ball hits the frame. It
is fast-paced ball game where players are required to jump, throw and catch
balls, as well as run around the court.</p>

our teams for the annual Inter-School Tchoukball Championships. During
training, our boys and girls persevere and embrace challenges even when
training gets tough.</p>

<h4>Training sessions</h4>
<p>Tchoukball is a fast-paced ball game where players are required to jump,
throw and catch balls. Our training sessions are held regularly by an external
coach where students will gain mastery in their throwing (underhand throw,
overhand throw and side arm throw), shooting (jump shot and stand shot)
and catching (two-handed catch and ⁠single-handed catch) techniques.</p>
<p>Before every competition season, our students attend additional training
sessions. Theses sessions provide an avenue for our students to further
practise and hone their throwing, shooting and catching techniques.</p>
