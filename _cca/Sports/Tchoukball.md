**Tchoukball** is an indoor team sport developed in the 1970s by Hermann Brandt as a warm up activity for the Swiss Handball team. The sport is usually played on an indoor court measuring 27 metres by 16 metres. At each end there is a 'frame' (a device similar to a trampoline off which the ball bounces) which measures one square metre and a semicircular D-shaped forbidden zone measuring three metres in radius. Each team can score on both ends on the field, and comprises twelve players, of which seven may be on the court at any one time. In order to score a point, the ball must be thrown by an attacking player, hit the frame and bounce outside the 'D' without being caught by the defending team.

Tchoukball training sessions are held regularly by an external coach to prepare our teams for the National Primary Schools Tchoukball Competition held yearly. Students from both girls and boys teams apply their GM messages during their training to persevere and never give up even when training gets tough.

In 2022, MPS Tchoukball Boys and Girls teams participated in the National Primary Schools Tchoukball Competition junior categories. The students gained valuable experiences by competing with teams from all over Singapore.
