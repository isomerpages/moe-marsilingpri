<p><strong>Tchoukball</strong>&nbsp;is an indoor team sport developed in the 1970s by Hermann Brandt as a warm up activity for the Swiss Handball team. The sport is usually played on an indoor court measuring 27 metres by 16 metres. At each end there is a 'frame' (a device similar to a trampoline&nbsp;off which the ball bounces) which measures one square metre and a semicircular D-shaped forbidden zone measuring three metres in radius. Each team can score on both ends on the field, and comprises twelve players, of which seven may be on the court at any one time. In order to score a point, the ball must be thrown by an attacking player, hit the frame and bounce outside the 'D' without being caught by the defending team.</p><p>Tchoukball training sessions are held regularly by an external coach to prepare our teams for the National Primary Schools Tchoukball Competition held yearly. Students from both girls and boys teams apply their GM messages during their training to persevere and never give up even when training gets tough.</p><p>In 2022, MPS Tchoukball Boys and Girls teams participated in the National Primary Schools Tchoukball Competition junior categories. The students gained valuable experiences by competing with teams from all over Singapore.</p><p><strong>List of Achievements in 2022 â€“ 12th National Primary Schools Tchoukball Competition</strong></p><p>Junior Boys (Bowl Category) ~ 5th</p><p>Junior Boys (Cup Category)&nbsp; ~ 7th</p><p>Junior Girls (Bowl Category)&nbsp; ~ 5th</p><p>Junior Girls (Cup Category)&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp; 5th</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teachers-in-Charge</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Venue</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Time</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Miss Tan Cassander(I/C)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>ISH (Level 3)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Thursday, 3.15pm-4.45pm</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Sam Tan(2nd I/C)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Jamaliah Yusope Lamat </p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Miss Lim Duyue Ferlicia</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tchouk1.png"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tchouk2.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tchouk3.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/tchouk4.png"></div><p></p>
