<h4><strong>About Badminton</strong></h4>
<p>In MPS Badminton, our main aim is for students to love and appreciate
the sport, and to be able to acquire skills that will allow them to play
with their friends and family members in their free time.</p>
<p>The students learn the basic skills and footwork of Badminton. Friendly
matches are conducted internally to provide the students with the opportunity
to apply what they learnt during CCA. With dedication, discipline, and
a willingness to learn and adapt, students develop a resilient mindset
through the CCA.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>Weekly fun-filled matches</h4>
<p>MPS Badminton conducts friendly badminton matches during its CCA sessions.
These matches typically prioritise enjoyment, camaraderie, and skill development
over intense competition and winning. They provide an opportunity for players
of varying skill levels to come together and engage in the sport in a relaxed
atmosphere. Friendly matches are an excellent way our players stay active,
hone their skills, and socialise with peers who share a passion for badminton.</p>
