<h4><strong>About Modular Sports</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Modular Sports, our main aim is for students to love and appreciate
the sport, and to be able to acquire skills that will allow them to play
with their friends and family members in their free time.</p>
<p>The students learn the basic skills and footwork of Badminton and Basketball.
Friendly matches are conducted internally to provide the students with
the opportunity to apply what they learnt during CCA. With dedication,
discipline, and a willingness to learn and adapt, students develop a resilient
mindset through the CCA.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>Weekly fun-filled matches</h4>
<p>MPS Modular Sports conducts friendly badminton and basketball matches
during its CCA sessions. These matches typically prioritise enjoyment,
camaraderie, and skill development over intense competition and winning.
They provide an opportunity for players of varying skill levels to come
together and engage in the sport in a relaxed atmosphere. Friendly matches
are an excellent way our players stay active, hone their skills, and socialize
with peers who share a passion for badminton and basketball.</p>
