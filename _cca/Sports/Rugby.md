<h4><strong>About Rugby</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Rugby aims to equip students with the technical skills (tackling,
rucking &amp; scrummaging) of rugby and how to play the sport confidently
and safely. Besides the physical, students learn values such as teamwork,
resilience and overcoming their fears and inhibitions. Students have the
opportunity to showcase their skills annually at the National School Games.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CCA aims to provide a pathway for students to pursue
the sport in secondary school through Direct School Admission (DSA). Throughout
the years, successful applicants have been able to continue their passion
of the game in Admiralty Secondary, Evergreen Secondary &amp; St Andrew’s
Secondary.</p>
