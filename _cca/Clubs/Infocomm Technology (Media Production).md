<h4><strong>About Infocomm Technology (Media Production)</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Infocomm Technology (Media Production), students are given the opportunities
to explore the current Infocomm Technologies.</p>
<p>Students acquire knowledge in different programming functions and create
simple coding sequences that allows them in games development using SCRATCH
or mbot.</p>
<p>The club members will also learn about AI and Drone technologies as well
as programming using the Micro:Bit board. The students also have opportunities
to participate in Learning Journey (LJ) and various competitions held at
different time of the year.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>Drone Flying Programme</h4>
<p>The programme offers students the chance to develop coding skills by creating
programs to fly drones and accomplish designated tasks. This activity offers
students the opportunity to enhance their troubleshooting skills and logical
thinking while fostering teamwork through collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>View the video below, featuring our students experimenting with the drones
and figuring out how to steer them in their desired directions.</p>

<h4>P3 Scratch Programming</h4>
<p>Our P3 students started off their first CCA program with learning about
block-based coding using Scratch 3.0. The students learned the basic functions
and commands in Scratch, and eventually they were trained to develop their
own games using Scratch 3.0.</p>

<h4>P4 Coding on BBC Micro:bit Board</h4>
<p>The P4 to P6 students continued with their application of block-based
programming using the BBC Micro:bit board. Through the program, students
learned to integrate input devices such as moisture detector, light and
proximity sensors to communicate with the Micro:bit board to perform a
desired output function.</p>
