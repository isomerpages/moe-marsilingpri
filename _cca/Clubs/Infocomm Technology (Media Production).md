<h4><strong>About Infocomm Technology (Media Production)</strong></h4>
<p>In MPS Infocomm Technology (Media Production), students are given the
opportunities to explore the current Infocomm Technologies.</p>
<p>Students acquire knowledge in different programming functions and create
simple coding sequences that allows them in games development using SCRATCH
or mbot.</p>
<p>The club members will also learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Drone technologies as well as programming using the Micro:Bit board. The
students also have opportunities to participate in Learning Journey (LJ)
and various competitions held at different time of the year.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>Drone Flying Programme</h4>
<p>The programme offers students the chance to develop coding skills by creating
programmes to fly drones and accomplish designated tasks. This activity
offers students the opportunity to enhance their troubleshooting skills
and logical thinking while fostering teamwork through collaboration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>View the video below, featuring our students experimenting with the drones
and figuring out how to steer them in their desired directions.</p>

<h4>P3 Scratch Programming</h4>
<p>Our P3 students starts off their first CCA programme with learning about
block-based coding using Scratch 3.0. The students learn the basic functions
and commands in Scratch, and eventually they are train to develop their
own games using Scratch 3.0.</p>

<h4>P4 Coding on BBC Micro:bit Board</h4>
<p>The P4 to P6 students continue with their application of block-based programming
using the BBC Micro:bit board. Through the programme, students will learn
to integrate input devices such as moisture detector, light and proximity
sensors to communicate with the Micro:bit board to perform a desire output
function.</p>
