<h4><strong>About Environmental Science</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Environmental Science Club endeavours to cultivate its members into
proactive and conscientious environmental stewards through a tailored suite
of Environmental Programmes. These programmes are designed to imbue participants
with constructive values and attitudes toward scientific inquiry, empowering
them to discern and address environmental issues. Students will acquire
the capacity to identify and resolve scientific investigative queries pertaining
to the environment. Moreover, they will be afforded opportunities to assume
leadership roles in championing green initiatives both within the school
environment and the wider community. Additionally, engagement in competitions
centered on environmental and scientific themes will serve to further augment
their knowledge and skills in this domain.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlights</strong></h4>
<h4>World Water Day</h4>
<p>This year students from the Environmental Science program participated
in World Water Day Symposium at Dunman High School. This year’s annual
celebration focus was on “Leveraging Water for Peace - Climate Change and
Water Security”.</p>
<p>Students participated in many interactive games and through these activities,
students&nbsp;were able to :</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand how climate change affects water security, including changes
in precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware of the importance of fostering international collaboration and
cooperation to manage water resources effectively and prevent conflicts
arising from competition for access to water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand Singapore’s water story and learn more about the 4 national
taps.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Gardening @MPS</h4>
<p>Gardening is not just about growing plants; it's a fascinating exploration
of the natural world that can spark curiosity and wonder in students. In
this activity, students in the Environmental Club will have the opportunity
to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty as they delve into the
art and science of gardening. Through this hands-on experience, students
will learn about plant biology, ecology, sustainability, and the interconnectedness
of living organisms in a fun and engaging way.</p>
<p>The objective of this gardening activity is to introduce students to the
basic principles of gardening, foster an appreciation for nature, and inspire
curiosity about the natural world. By actively participating in planting,
caring for, and observing plants, students will not only learn about plant
life cycles and ecosystems but also develop important skills such as teamwork,
responsibility, and problem-solving.</p>

<h4>Sustainability Challenges</h4>
<p>Students from the Environmental Science program are actively engaged in
the sorting process of donated garments, graciously contributed by their
peers at MPS as part of our Sustainability Challenge 2, the Clothes Donation
Drive. Under the guidance of senior students, they meticulously assess
the suitability of each item for donation, meticulously fold and pack them
into bags, poised for dispatch to CLOOP. This endeavor not only underscores
our commitment to sustainability by promoting the reuse of clothing but
also facilitates intergenerational collaboration and mentorship within
our community. The subsequent dispatch of these items to CLOOP ensures
their responsible recycling or reuse, thereby furthering the principles
of a circular economy.</p>
