<h4><strong>About Environmental Science</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Environmental Science Club endeavours to cultivate its members into
proactive and conscientious environmental stewards through a tailored suite
of Environmental Programmes. These programmes are designed to imbue participants
with constructive values and attitudes toward scientific inquiry, empowering
them to discern and address environmental issues. Students will acquire
the capacity to identify and resolve scientific investigative queries pertaining
to the environment. Moreover, they will be afforded opportunities to assume
leadership roles in championing green initiatives both within the school
environment and the wider community. Additionally, engagement in competitions
centered on environmental and scientific themes will serve to further augment
their knowledge and skills in this domain.</p>
