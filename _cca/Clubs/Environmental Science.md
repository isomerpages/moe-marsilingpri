<h4><strong>About Environmental Science</strong></h4>
<p>MPS Environmental Science club endeavors to cultivate its members into
proactive and conscientious environmental stewards through a tailored suite
of Environmental Programs. These programs are designed to imbue participants
with constructive values and attitudes toward scientific inquiry, empowering
them to discern and address environmental issues. Students will acquire
the capacity to identify and resolve scientific investigative queries pertaining
to the environment. Moreover, they will be afforded opportunities to assume
leadership roles in championing green initiatives both within the school
environment and the wider community. Additionally, engagement in competitions
centered on environmental and scientific themes will serve to further augment
their knowledge and skills in this domain.</p>

<h4><strong>CCA Highlight(s)</strong></h4>
<h4>Sustainability Challenge</h4>
<p>Students from the Environmental Science program are actively engaged in
the sorting process of donated garments, graciously contributed by their
peers at MPS as part of our Sustainability Challenge 2, the Clothes Donation
Drive. Under the guidance of senior students, they meticulously assess
the suitability of each item for donation, meticulously fold and pack them
into bags, poised for dispatch to CLOOP. This endeavor not only underscores
our commitment to sustainability by promoting the reuse of clothing but
also facilitates intergenerational collaboration and mentorship within
our community. The subsequent dispatch of these items to CLOOP ensures
their responsible recycling or reuse, thereby furthering the principles
of a circular economy.</p>
